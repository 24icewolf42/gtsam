/** This solver uses sequential variable elimination to solve a
 * GaussianFactorGraph, i.e. a sparse linear system.  Underlying this is a
 * column elimination tree (inference/EliminationTree), see Gilbert 2001 BIT.
 *
 * The elimination ordering is "baked in" to the variable indices at this
 * stage, i.e. elimination proceeds in order from '0'.  A fill-reducing
 * ordering is computed symbolically from the NonlinearFactorGraph, on the
 * nonlinear side of gtsam.  (To be precise, it is possible to permute an
 * existing GaussianFactorGraph into a COLAMD ordering instead, this is done
 * when computing marginals).
 *
 * This is not the most efficient algorithm we provide, most efficient is the
 * MultifrontalSolver, which performs Multi-frontal QR factorization.  However,
 * sequential variable elimination is easier to understand so this is a good
 * starting point to learn about these algorithms and our implementation.
 * Additionally, the first step of MFQR is symbolic sequential elimination.
 *
 * The EliminationTree recursively produces a BayesNet<GaussianConditional>,
 * typedef'ed in linear/GaussianBayesNet, on which this class calls
 * optimize(...) to perform back-substitution.
