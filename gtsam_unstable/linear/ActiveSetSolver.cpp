/*
 * The goal of this function is to find currently active inequality constraints
 * that violate the condition to be active. The one that violates the condition
 * the most will be removed from the active set. See Nocedal06book, pg 469-471
 *
 * Find the BAD active inequality that pulls x strongest to the wrong direction
 * of its constraint (i.e. it is pulling towards >0, while its feasible region is <=0)
 *
 * For active inequality constraints (those that are enforced as equality constraints
 * in the current working set), we want lambda < 0.
 * This is because:
 *   - From the Lagrangian L = f - lambda*c, we know that the constraint force
 *     is (lambda * \grad c) = \grad f. Intuitively, to keep the solution x stay
 *     on the constraint surface, the constraint force has to balance out with
 *     other unconstrained forces that are pulling x towards the unconstrained
 *     minimum point. The other unconstrained forces are pulling x toward (-\grad f),
 *     hence the constraint force has to be exactly \grad f, so that the total
 *     force is 0.
 *   - We also know that  at the constraint surface c(x)=0, \grad c points towards + (>= 0),
 *     while we are solving for - (<=0) constraint.
 *   - We want the constraint force (lambda * \grad c) to pull x towards the - (<=0) direction
 *     i.e., the opposite direction of \grad c where the inequality constraint <=0 is satisfied.
 *     That means we want lambda < 0.
 *   - This is because when the constrained force pulls x towards the infeasible region (+),
 *     the unconstrained force is pulling x towards the opposite direction into
 *     the feasible region (again because the total force has to be 0 to make x stay still)
 *     So we can drop this constraint to have a lower error but feasible solution.
 *
 * In short, active inequality constraints with lambda > 0 are BAD, because they
 * violate the condition to be active.
 *
 * And we want to remove the worst one with the largest lambda from the active set.
