   * A simple factor class to use in a factor graph.
   *
   * We make it noncopyable so we enforce the fact that factors are
   * kept in pointer containers. To be safe, you should make them
   * immutable, i.e., practicing functional programming. However, this
   * conflicts with efficiency as well, esp. in the case of incomplete
   * QR factorization. A solution is still being sought.
   * 
   * A Factor is templated on a Config, for example VectorConfig is a configuration of
   * labeled vectors. This way, we can have factors that might be defined on discrete
   * variables, continuous ones, or a combination of both. It is up to the config to 
   * provide the appropriate values at the appropriate time.
