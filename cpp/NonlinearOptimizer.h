	 * The class NonlinearOptimizer encapsulates an optimization state.
	 * Typically it is instantiated with a NonlinearFactorGraph and an initial config
	 * and then one of the optimization routines is called. These recursively iterate
	 * until convergence. All methods are functional and return a new state.
	 *
	 * The class is parameterized by the Config class type, in order to optimize
	 * over non-vector configurations as well.
	 * To use in code, include <gtsam/NonlinearOptimizer.cpp> in your cpp file
	 * (the trick in http://www.ddj.com/cpp/184403420 did not work).
