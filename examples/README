This directory contains a number of exapmples that illustrate the use of GTSAM:

SimpleRotation:  a super-simple example of optimizing a single rotation according to a single prior

2D Pose SLAM 
============
Pose2SLAMExample_easy: A 2D Pose SLAM example using the predefined typedefs in gtsam/slam/pose2SLAM.h
Pose2SLAMExample_advanced: same, but uses an Optimizer object
Pose2SLAMwSPCG_easy: solve a simple 3 by 3 grid of Pose2 SLAM problem by using easy SPCG interface
Pose2SLAMwSPCG_advanced: solve a simple 3 by 3 grid of Pose2 SLAM problem by using advanced SPCG interface

Planar SLAM with landmarks
==========================
PlanarSLAMExample: simple robotics example using the pre-built planar SLAM domain
PlanarSLAMSelfContained_advanced: simple robotics example with all typedefs internal to this script.

Visual SLAM
===========
The directory vSLAMexample includes 2 simple examples using GTSAM:
- vSFMexample using visualSLAM in for structure-from-motion (SFM), and
- vISAMexample using visualSLAM and ISAM for incremental SLAM updates
See the separate README file there.
